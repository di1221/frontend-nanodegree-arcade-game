===============================

1. User opens the game and should see several enemies (bugs) moving across the bricked
area at various speeds.

2.  User should also see 1 sprite (the player) in the grassy area of the board

3.  If the user is in Chrome (any version) they will see a red button that reads 'Select Player'

4.  User has the option to click that button in order to open a new window to select a new player sprite from 5 options.  This option can be exercised during any point in the game during, before, or after.

5. If and when the user selects a different sprite the window should automatically close and the newly selected sprite should now be in the initial player location.

6.  If the user decides not to select a new sprite they can click 'cancel' and the window will close, and the game with the original sprite should be seen.

7.  If the user is on any other browser, they will not have the option to select a new sprite and the 'select player' button should NOT be visible to them.

8. The player begins the game by moving the player sprite up, down, left and right.  This is done by using the left, right, up, down areas on the keyboard.

9.  When the player moves all the way up, down, left, or right the sprite should stop and not move any further in that direction.

10.  The goal of the game is for the player to reach the water section(by moving as described the line above) at the top of the board without running in to any of the enemy sprites.  If the user successfully reaches the water, the game should stop.  The user should no longer be able to move the sprite and the screen should read 'game over' at the top, and 'You're a winner' at the bottom.  There should also be a button that says play again.

11.  If the player does crash in to one of the enemies, the game should stop and the game over section should be seen as described previously.  There should be no words of praise at the bottom.

12.  To leave the the game or play again the user should click 'Play Again' which will bring them back to the original game screen where they can either play again or close out the game.
